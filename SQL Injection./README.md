# SQL Injection
  
  SQL Injection can be used in a range of ways to cause serious problems. By levering SQL Injection, an attacker could       bypass authentication, access, modify and delete data within a database. In some cases, SQL Injection can even be used     to execute commands on the operating system, potentially allowing an attacker to escalate to more damaging attacks         inside of a network that sits behind a firewall.
  
# Type of SQL Injection   
  SQL Injection can be classified into three major categories – In-band SQLi, Inferential SQLi and Out-of-band SQLi.  
 
 
 
  # 1. In-band SQL Injection (Classic SQL Injection)
        
   # • Error-based SQL Injection
     
   Error-based SQLi is an in-band SQK Injection technique that relies on error messages thriwb by the database server to obtain information about the structure if     the datebase
   
   # • Union-Based SQL Injection 
     
   Uion-based SQLi is ab ib-band SQL injection technique that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements.
     
     
  # 2. Inferential SQL Inection (Blind SQL Injection) 
   
  
   # Blind SQL Injection 
   it is just as dangerous as any other form of SQL Injection . In an Blind SQLi attack, no data is actually transferred via th eweb application and the attacker    woulf not be able to see the result of an attack
    
   The two types of Blind SQL Injection are:-
    
   • Boolean-based (content-based) 
  
   • Time-based Blind SQL Injection
   
  # 3. Out-of-band SQL Injection
  
   Out of band SQL injection is not very commaon, mostly because it depends on feature being enabled on the database server being used by the web application. Out    of band SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is unable to use the same chennel to launch the attack and gather result.
