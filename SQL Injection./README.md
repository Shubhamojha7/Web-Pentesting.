# SQL Injection
  
  SQL Injection can be used in a range of ways to cause serious problems. By levering SQL Injection, an attacker could       bypass authentication, access, modify and delete data within a database. In some cases, SQL Injection can even be used     to execute commands on the operating system, potentially allowing an attacker to escalate to more damaging attacks         inside of a network that sits behind a firewall.
  
# Type of SQL Injection   
  SQL Injection can be classified into three major categories – In-band SQLi, Inferential SQLi and Out-of-band SQLi.  
 
 
 
  # 1. In-band SQL Injection (Classic SQL Injection)
        
   • Error-based SQL Injection
   
   • Union-Based SQL Injection 

  # 2. Inferential SQL Inection (Blind SQL Injection) 
   
  
   Blind SQL Injection 

   • Boolean-based (content-based) 

   • Time-based Blind SQL Injection
   
  # 3. Out-of-band SQL Injection
